The idea for this project is to create a model that can detect whether a glass
is 6 or 12 ounces and how much of it is filled. This is my first time working on
anything like this so it might not even work but gotta start somewhere :)

Update 8/26: it works and it can identify the glass sizes, but not exactly the fills.
    might need to tweak a few things
